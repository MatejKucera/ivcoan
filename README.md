# IVAO Controllers Announcer (Discord Bot)

This is a Discord Bot that announces when IVAO controller from defined FIR joins the network and when he/she disconnects.

## Disclaimer

This application is work in progress.

Please note, that I am not a professional Node JS developer (I'm PHP geek ðŸ¤“), so this code is probably quite bad. It suits it's purpose and works just fine, but please do not use it as inspiration of how to code in Node JS.
